We built a machine learning model to classify emotions from natural language text using a combination of logistic regression, random forests, text embeddings and BERT. Starting from bag-of-words, we improved performance through using more complex deep learning algorithms aiming to beat baseline models on the Kaggle leaderboard of our classmates and explore the emotional nuance behind human language.
